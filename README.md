# YogaLibrary
The poses in this project are not exact. I used placeholder text to simulate what the description would look like. 

To use this project
1. Bring index.html to your browser window. 
2. Click on the drop-down menu at top left-hand corner of page
3. Click on library
4. To search for a specific pose via keyword type a keyword that relates to the asana ex) Cat-Cow for pose or "shoulder" for keyword associated with the pose.
4. In the menu at the top left hand corner select "create routine".
5. Selcet asanas you would like to focus on. 
6. Select "Do routine" to display only poses you'd like to work on.. Enjoy!


This is the first project I created in The Last Mile without the help of traditional internet resources. It was created in 2020.
